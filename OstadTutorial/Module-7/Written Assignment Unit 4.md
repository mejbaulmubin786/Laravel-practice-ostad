To solve this problem, we will use the concepts of monopoly pricing, marginal cost, and profit maximization.

### Part a) How much will the firm produce?
To find the quantity produced by a monopolist, we set Marginal Revenue (MR) equal to Marginal Cost (MC).

1. **Calculate the MR:**
   The demand curve is \( P = 500 - 10Q \).

   Total Revenue (TR) = \( P \times Q = (500 - 10Q)Q = 500Q - 10Q^2 \).

   Marginal Revenue (MR) is the derivative of Total Revenue with respect to Q:
   \[
   MR = \frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 500 - 20Q
   \]

2. **Set MR equal to MC:**  
   Given \( MC = 100 \),
   \[
   500 - 20Q = 100
   \]
   \[
   400 = 20Q
   \]
   \[
   Q = 20
   \]

So, the firm will produce 20 units.

### Part b) How much will it charge?
To find the price, substitute \( Q = 20 \) into the demand equation:
\[
P = 500 - 10Q = 500 - 10(20) = 500 - 200 = 300
\]

The firm will charge $300 per unit.

### Part c) Can you determine its profit per day?
Profit is Total Revenue (TR) minus Total Cost (TC).

1. **Calculate TR:**
   \[
   TR = P \times Q = 300 \times 20 = 6000
   \]

2. **Calculate TC:**
   \[
   TC = MC \times Q = 100 \times 20 = 2000
   \]

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   \[
   Profit = TR - TC = 6000 - 2000 = 4000
   \]

The firm's profit per day is $4000.

### Part d) Suppose a tax of $1,000 per day is imposed on the firm. How will this affect its price?
A fixed tax does not affect the marginal cost or the output decision of the firm. The price remains the same at $300.

### Part e) How would the $1,000 per day tax affect its output per day?
The output will remain the same because the marginal cost and marginal revenue, which determine output, are unaffected by a fixed tax. So, the firm will still produce 20 units per day.

### Part f) How would the $1,000 per day tax affect its profit per day?
1. **New Profit Calculation:**
   The new profit = Original profit - Tax
   \[
   New\ Profit = 4000 - 1000 = 3000
   \]

The firm's profit per day after the tax is $3000.

### Part g) Now suppose a tax of $100 per unit is imposed. How will this affect the firm’s price?
A per-unit tax increases the marginal cost by the amount of the tax.

1. **New MC:**
   \[
   MC_{new} = MC + Tax = 100 + 100 = 200
   \]

2. **Set MR equal to the new MC:**
   \[
   500 - 20Q = 200
   \]
   \[
   300 = 20Q
   \]
   \[
   Q = 15
   \]

3. **New Price:**
   \[
   P = 500 - 10Q = 500 - 10(15) = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

The new price will be $350 per unit.

### Part h) How would a $100 per unit tax affect the firm’s profit-maximizing output per day?
The new profit-maximizing output is 15 units per day, as calculated in part g.

### Part i) How would the $100 per unit tax affect the firm’s profit per day?
1. **New TR:**
   \[
   TR = P \times Q = 350 \times 15 = 5250
   \]

2. **New TC:**
   \[
   TC = MC_{new} \times Q = 200 \times 15 = 3000
   \]

3. **Tax Paid:**
   \[
   Total\ Tax = 100 \times 15 = 1500
   \]

4. **New Profit:**
   \[
   New\ Profit = TR - TC - Total\ Tax = 5250 - 3000 - 1500 = 750
   \]

The firm's profit per day after the per-unit tax is $750.
